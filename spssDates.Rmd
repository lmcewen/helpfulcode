###Converting dates exported from SPSS to actual dates and not random numbers

Problem: 
Meta data file exported from SPSS into R has numeric coded dates, "13254710400", need to convert to actual date...

Answer: (http://scs.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Importing_dates_from_SPSS)
Apparently, "dates in SPSS are recorded in seconds since October 14, 1582, the date of the beginning of the Julian calendar. To transform the value to the R "Date" format, you simply need to turn seconds into days and specify the origin. The following function will do the trick:"

code:
```{r eval = FALSE}
spss2date <- function(x) as.Date(x/86400, origin = "1582-10-14")
spss2date(13510000000)
# "2010-11-24"
``
